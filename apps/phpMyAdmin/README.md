# phpMyAdmin

PhpMyAdmin allows the simple management of MySQL (or in this case, MariaDB) databases from a web UI.

## Building the phpMyAdmin app

From the project root directory:

```bash
./build.sh phpMyAdmin
```

The WD bin files will be created in `packages/phpMyAdmin/`.

If you don't have docker installed, see the [guide](../../docker/README.md) in the `docker` directory. If you're on Windows 10 or 11, see the [Windows guide](../../docker/WINDOWS.md) for WSL / docker installation.
