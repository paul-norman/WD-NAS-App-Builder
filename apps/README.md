# Apps

This `apps` directory houses the build files for all WD NAS devices in their own directories.

They are all packaged from an editable `build.sh` bash file, which has a few helpers to parse the `apkg.rc` file and load some useful variables and functions into it *(see [Build Helpers](#build-helpers) below)*.

They must contain all the shell files as described in the [guide](../guides/README.md#package-contents), but to make creating these files easier, they all load in an identical set of pre-defined variables and functions *(see [Script Helpers](#script-helpers) below)*.

## Building an app

From the project root directory:

```bash
./build.sh <app_name>
```

The WD bin files will be created in `packages/ <app_name>/`.

If you don't have docker installed, see the [guide](../../docker/README.md) in the `docker` directory. If you're on Windows 10 or 11, see the [Windows guide](../../docker/WINDOWS.md) for WSL / docker installation.

## Build Helpers

The `build_helpers.sh` defines some useful variables and functions, but also ensures that files are moved to the correct locations before and after build.

In addition to these, build scripts also load in all [APKG helpers](#apkg-helpers).

### Variables

| Variable         | Description                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `${APP_PATH}`    | The absolute path of the app                     |
| `${APP_NAME}`    | The directory name *(name)* of the app           |
| `${APP_VERSION}` | The version of the app                           |
| `${APPS_PATH}`   | The absolute path of the parent `apps` directory |
| `${REPO_PATH}`   | The absolute path of the whole project directory |
| `${RELEASE_DIR}` | The directory where this app will be built       |

### Functions

`build()` - handles building the package. It accepts a list of [model names](../guides/README.md#packaging-command) and a final variable of the architecture *(either `amd64` or `armhf`) for those specific models.

```bash
build "MyCloudPR4100" "MyCloudPR2100" "WDMyCloudDL4100" "WDMyCloudDL2100" "amd64"
```

`abort()` - stops execution and restores any temporarily moved files with an error message.

```bash
abort "$(pwd)/filename could not be found"
```

## Script Helpers

WD NAS device scripts are called from two locations and with three combinations of input parameters! This script normalises this and provides a consistent set of variables / functions for each.

In addition to these, all scripts also load in all [APKG helpers](#apkg-helpers).

### Variables

## APKG Helpers

The helpers for the `apkg.rc` file may be used **both** in the local build script and on the WD NAS devices, so it has been separated into its own file.
